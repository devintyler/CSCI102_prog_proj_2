Welcome to CSCI-102.4 Programming Project 2

By Devin Visslailli

This project is going to use a recursive formula to browse through a directory and scan each file and subdirectory that can be seen. It will then find the size of those files and directories and print them to screen in order.

This will be implemented through the use of a LinkedList Structure and recursion.

All coded in Java.
